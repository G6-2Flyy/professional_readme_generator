# README.md Generator

## Description

The purpose of this open-source project is to create an application that dynamically generates a professional README by using Node.js, Inquirer v8.2.4, and CLI based on user inputs derived from an array of questions. 

- The motivation for this application stems from how it allows project creators to devote more time executing the project rather than manually producing documentation.
- This application was created to eliminate and replace having to manually produce this widely used documentation.
- By automating this process, this application saves on consuming one of the most precious resources known - time.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
